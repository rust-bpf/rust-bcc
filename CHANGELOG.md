# [Unreleased]

# [0.0.25] - 2020-09-15
## Added
- Support for bcc 0.16.0
- Builder-pattern construction of `BPF` struct.
- Support for passing `CFLAGS` to BPF module creation.
- Builder-pattern construction of `PerfMap`s.
- Support for setting the size of the `PerfMap` ring buffer.

## Changed
- Default bcc version is now 0.16.0
- Some function signatures now return `Result`s to enable better error handling
  and reduce internal `unwrap()` usage.
- Some error types now include additional messaging.

## Fixed
- Builds on `aarch64` by correcting the internal representation of `char` types.

# [0.0.24] - 2020-08-20
## Fixed
- `Kprobe`s and `Uprobe`s are now properly closed on drop. Fixed #44

# [0.0.23] - 2020-08-13
## Added
- Support for `BPF_PERF_ARRAY`.

## Fixed
- `PerfEvent`s are not properly closed on drop.
- BPF `Table` now returns the value for the first entry instead of always
  returning zero for the first entry.

# [0.0.22] - 2020-08-03
## Added
- Support for attaching probes to perf events and related examples.
- Implementation of `get_syscall_fnname` to support in resolving system calls to
  function names.

## Changed
- Converted probe construction to a builder-style pattern with new public types
  to initialize and attach probes.
- Changed `bcc::core` to now be internal only. Public interface to core
  functionality is now in the root of the module.

# [0.0.21] - 2020-07-24
## Fixed
- Iterating on an empty table would improperly return an entry (#100)
- Fixed some issues with static linking by pulling in a newer version of bcc-sys

## Changed

# [0.0.17] - 2020-03-20
## Added
- Added support for bcc 0.13.0

## Changed
- Changed default bcc version to 0.13.0
- Updated dependencies

# [0.0.16] - 2020-02-03
## Added
- Makes BPF struct both `Send` and `Sync` by using `AtomicPtr`s instead of bare
  pointers

# [0.0.15] - 2020-01-10
## Added

## Added
- Added support to pull multiple perf buffers at once

# [0.0.12] - 2019-09-16
## Added
- Added `biosnoop` example which traces block device IO and is used to test the 
  `get_kprobe_functions()` function in CI

## Fixed
- Use explicit `dyn` on trait objects
- Fixed segfault caused by passing non-null buffer to `bpf_prog_load()`

# [0.0.11] - 2019-09-07
## Added
- Added `runqlat` example to get the distribution of runqueue latency and
  exercise kprobes during CI
- Added `get_kprobe_functions()` which exists in the Python API

## Fixed
- Fixed the 'oh no' bug which would cause panic when using rust-bcc for perf
  events on some systems. Particularly, this would trigger if some CPUs were
  offline

# [0.0.10] - 2019-07-08
## Added
- Added bcc 0.10.0 support
- Added signal handler to examples for `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` so that `Drop`

# [0.0.9] - 2019-05-22
## Fixed
- Fixed an issue with static linking by updating the `bcc-sys` dependency

# [0.0.7] - 2019-05-14
